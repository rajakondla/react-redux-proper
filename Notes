   This is the babel preset that create react-app uses.
3) To automate the build process we use npm scripts

   a) extends will enable recommended rules for react, imports etc
   b) babel-eslint to assure eslint understand our code
   c) parserOptions version of ecma script, esmodules, jsx
   d) env tells eslint to expect certain global variables. eslint ingore this variables
   e) rules tells eslint not to throw error if we use these rules
   f) settings react version "detect" required by eslint-plugin-react telling to detect the version of react automatically.
      If not eslint-react-plugin throw error version not specified.
   g) root:true this is the eslint config should used for this project. If there is any other config or files for eslint will be ignored.
